# Macro Assembler 

## Project Overview

This project implements a **Two-Pass Assembler** tailored for an 8085-like microprocessor assembly language. The assembler converts human-readable assembly code into machine code by processing the source code in two distinct passes:

- **Pass 1:** Scans the source code to identify labels, macros, and calculate addresses, building the symbol table and macro definitions without producing machine code.
- **Pass 2:** Expands macros, resolves symbolic addresses, generates the actual machine opcodes, and outputs the final machine code.

This approach mirrors real-world assembler designs, ensuring forward references (e.g., jumps to labels defined later) are correctly handled. The project also supports basic instructions, data directives (`DB`, `DW`), and macro facilities with parameters.

## Motivation

Assemblers are foundational tools in systems programming, bridging the gap between human-readable code and machine instructions. Implementing a two-pass assembler deepens understanding of compiler design principles, symbol resolution, and code generation.

Real-life assemblers rely on multiple passes to handle forward references and complex macros efficiently. This project simulates these core concepts, reinforcing practical compiler construction knowledge with hands-on coding in:

- **C** for core logic  
- **Assembler language** for instruction processing  
- **Lex & Yacc** for lexical analysis and parsing

Additionally, an optional web UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript facilitates interactive assembly code input and output display.

## Features

- **Macro Processing:** Define reusable code blocks with parameters, expanded in Pass 2  
- **Symbol Table Management:** Collects labels and their addresses, resolving forward references  
- **Two-Pass Architecture:**  
  - Pass 1: Scans, stores symbols and macros, calculates instruction addresses  
  - Pass 2: Expands macros, generates machine code, and resolves labels  
- **Instruction Support:** Includes common 8085 instructions like `MVI`, `MOV`, `ADD`, `INR`, `JMP`, `NOP`, `HLT`  
- **Data Directives:** Supports `DB` (Define Byte) and `DW` (Define Word)  
- **Output:** Generates hexadecimal machine code with memory addresses  
- **User Interface:** A simple, clean UI for code editing and output viewing (optional)

## Implementation Details

### Languages and Tools Used

- **C:** Core implementation of Pass 1 and Pass 2 logic  
- **8085 Assembly:** Used for low-level instruction processing and macros  
- **Lex (Flex):** Tokenizes assembly source code, macro keywords, labels, and instructions  
- **Yacc (Bison):** Parses tokenized input into syntax trees and handles grammar rules for macros and directives  
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** Optional front-end UI to input assembly code and display machine code output dynamically  

### Pass 1: Symbol Table and Macro Storage

- Parses assembly lines sequentially  
- Identifies and stores label names with corresponding addresses in a symbol table  
- Detects macro definitions and stores their bodies without expansion  
- Calculates instruction sizes for address assignment without generating machine code  
- Builds a comprehensive macro table

### Pass 2: Macro Expansion and Machine Code Generation

- Processes the source code again, this time expanding macros inline where invoked  
- Converts mnemonics and operands into machine opcodes according to the 8085 instruction set  
- Resolves symbolic addresses in jump instructions using the symbol table  
- Handles data bytes and words as raw memory content  
- Outputs a hex dump with precise memory addresses for loading in an emulator or hardware

## How to Use

1. **Prepare your assembly source code:** Use labels, macros, instructions, and data directives.  
2. **Run Pass 1:** Generate the symbol table and macro definitions, verifying no syntax errors.  
3. **Run Pass 2:** Expand macros and generate the final machine code output.  
4. **Review output:** The machine code hex dump with addresses can be loaded into an 8085 simulator or hardware.  
5. *(Optional)* Use the web UI to input your code and get real-time output visualization.

### Challenges Faced

- **Symbol resolution:** Handling forward references and backpatching required a robust symbol table with efficient lookups.  
- **Macro expansion:** Avoiding infinite macro expansion loops and handling parameters posed logical challenges.  
- **Multi-language integration:** Coordinating between C, assembler, Lex, and Yacc was tricky but rewarding â€” it gave great insight into compiler toolchains.  
- **Address calculation:** Ensuring accurate address assignments when macros expand to variable instruction counts took careful design.

### Future Work & Enhancements

- Support for conditional assembly directives (`IF`, `ELSE`, `ENDIF`).  
- Expand instruction set for other architectures beyond 8085.  
- Implement code optimization passes to reduce machine code size.  
- Integrate an assembler debugger with step-by-step macro expansion visualization.  
- Enhance the UI with syntax highlighting, error detection, and suggestions.
